/* Formula: BMI = weight (pounds) / [height (in)]2 x 703

For example, if someone weighs 180 lbs and is 5'5" (65 in total), their BMI would be calculated as:
180 x 703 = 126,540
126,540 / 65 = 1,946.769
1,946.769 / 65 = 29.95%

// Collect user input on click
// Convert heightFeet from feet to inches (Multiply by 12)
// Add heightFeet and heightInches and set to a new variable called combinedHeight
// Multiply weight by 703
// Divide product of the above step and divide it by combinedHeight
// Divide the quotient of the above step again by combinedHeight to receive BMI
// Display BMI to the user
